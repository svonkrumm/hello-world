# hello-world
first repository on ghub


Hello, my name is Richard and this is my first attempt at using GitHub and moving into the modern workd of coding.

I was employed as programmer/analyst for approximately 11 years from 1988 until the birth of my first child.

Formally learning to code in COBOL, SQL, RPGII and RPG/400. 

Hardware platforms learnt include DEC-VAX, S/36, AS/400.

Late in the career, I learnt a little UNIX on IBM RISC systems with Oracle and Informix databases.

I worked for SSA Pacific on their BPCS ERP software.

Now just beginning to play around with Python and probably moving to web programming.

Hoping to have fun and possibly earn some money.
